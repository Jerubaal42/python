Concepts for Game:
You are a clanlord of a small clan, maintaining a holding similar to King of Dragon Pass

Three seasons: Growth Harvest Dark

	Growth season:
		Plant most crops, new year celebration, and animal births
		
	Harvest season:
		Harvest most crops, animal youth mature, plant some crops
		
	Dark season:
		Reduced food decay, but no plantable and few harvestable crops
	
Food
	~20% of your food decays each month, before the harvest
		~15% during Dark season
	Each "person" eats 1 food unit each month, regardless of whether they work or not
	Any additional food needed is taken from your animals
	Most animals produce a small amount of food each month
	There are five kinds of food: Meat Milk Grain Fruit Vegetable
		Meat is produced when an animal is butchered, and periodically from Chickens and Ducks
			Chickens produce 1 Meat every month per 5 Chickens
			Chickens are butchered for 3 Meat
			Ducks produce 1 Meat every month per 5 Ducks
			Ducks are butchered for 3 Meat
			Sheep are butchered for 10 Meat
			Goats are butchered for 10 Meat
			Cattle are butchered for 15 Meat
		Milk is produced periodically from Sheep, Goats, and Cattle during Growth
			Sheep produce 1 Milk every Growth month
			Goats produce 1 Milk every Growth month
			Cattle produce 1 Milk every Growth month
