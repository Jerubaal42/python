Concepts for Game:
You are a clanlord of a small clan, maintaining a holding similar to King of Dragon Pass
Your end goal is to join every demesne together and become the king

Three seasons: Growth Harvest Dark
	Growth season:
		Animal Births, Pop growth
	Harvest season:
		Animal youth mature
	Dark season:
		Reduced Food decay
	
Food
	~20% of your Food spoils each month, before the harvest
		~15% during Dark season
	Each Pop eats 1 Food each month, regardless of whether they work or not
	Any additional Food needed is taken from your animals
		Prioritizes to kill the fewest animals
		Sheep are preferred over Goats
		Chickens are preferred over Ducks
	Any Pop that cannot eat starves to death
	Most animals produce a small amount of Food each month
	There are five kinds of food: Meat Dairy Grain Fruit Vegetable
		Meat is produced when an animal is butchered, and periodically from Chickens and Ducks
			Chickens produce 1 Meat every month per 5 Chickens
			Chickens are butchered for 3 Meat
			Ducks produce 1 Meat every month per 5 Ducks
			Ducks are butchered for 3 Meat
			Sheep are butchered for 10 Meat
			Goats are butchered for 10 Meat
			Cattle are butchered for 15 Meat
		Dairy is produced periodically from Sheep, Goats, and Cattle during Growth
			Every four Sheep produces 1 Dairy every Growth month
			Every four Goat produces 1 Dairy every Growth month
			Every four Cattle produces 1 Dairy every Growth month
		Grain, Fruit and Vegetables are harvested as crops
			See kodp.ods for planting, growing, and harvesting times
	Each year in a row you plant the same crop, the yield decreases.
	Animals:
		Animals produce offspring in Growth
			Every four Sheep, Goats, or Cattle produce one offspring every year
			Every ten Chickens or Ducks produce one offspring every year
		Baby Animals are fully grown in Harvest
		Baby Animals do not produce Dairy or Meat
		Baby Animals butcher for half Meat (rounded down)
		Animals die of old age, and are automatically butchered
			Chickens die after 5 years
			Ducks die after 10 years
			Sheep die after 10 years
			Goats die after 15 years
			Cattle die after 20 years

Techniques
	Expeditions can acquire special techniques, and some are developed randomly over time
	Techniques listed in kodp.ods

Expeditions
	You can send out expeditions
	Expeditions have one of several goals: Conquest Exploration Diplomacy
		Conquest Expeditions are solving problems and conquering neighbors through force
		Exploration Expeditions are exploring the area and discovering new things
		Diplomacy Expeditions are attempts to appease, trade with, or integrate a neighbor via diplomacy
	You send out a Noble(s), a company, and supplies
	Each month, something happens on the expedition (Events)
		See kodp.ods for full list
	Events are multiple choice options with different success chances and skill checks
	The skills of your Noble(s) determine the success of each Event
	Different goals have different Events
	
Nobles
	You have a board of special people called Nobles
	Skills
	Everything that happens is tied to the skills of your Nobles
		Every time they use the skill, it has a chance to increase by 1
			lvluplist=[2,3,5,7]
			lvlupcheck=randint(0,3)
			if noblename.skillname%lvluplist[lvlupcheck]==randint(1,lvluplist[lvlupcheck]):
				noblename.skillname=noblename.skillname+1
		See kodp.ods for list of skills
	Advisors
		Advisors are Nobles that manage your clanhold
		Each Advisor affects a particular piece of your clanhold based on their skills
		Agriculture AGR Advisor - Head Farmer
			Increases food production
			Decreases food decay
			Directs crop planting
		Military MIL Advisor - General
			Increases military might
			Trains soldiers
			Leads soldiers into battle
		Health HLT Advisor - Head Practitioner
			Cures illnesses
			Heals injuries
			Provides healthcare
		Trade TRD Advisor - Head Merchant
			Oversees craftmaking

			Acquires wealth
		Judiciary JDG Advisor - Chief Judge
			Enforces the law
			Maintains order
			Judges
		Foreign Relations DIP Advisor - Diplomat
			Establishes treaties
			Performs diplomacy
			Provides counter-espionage
		Espionage SPY Advisor - Spymaster
			Steals Techniques and wealth
			Gathers information
			Acquire de jure claims
		
Military
	In order to declare war, you must have a de jure claim
	There are two military values: Defense Offense
		They are both identical to your clans Might, plus specific bonuses from MIL Adv. and Techniques
	You send your forces over to wherever you are attacking, and the results depend on the value of your Offense compared to the Defense of whomever you are invading
	Defense operates identically, though more Techniques increase Defense than Offense
	The attack is a Conquest expedition where you send a Noble(s), food, and a portion of your Might
	!!DANGER!! Might that is on an expedition is not used for Defense !!DANGER!!
	
Population
	Your Pop grows by 1% each Growth month
	Every month, each Pop eats one Food
	Disease kills % Pops based on severity
	Diseases
		Low Severity kills 1% Pop
		Medium Severity kills 3% Pop
		High Severity kills 5% Pop
		Full list in kodp.ods
	Conquering and Incorporating demesnes grants you Pops, with Incorporating giving more
	Two Pop categories: Workers Military
	Workers and Militia can be exchanged for free
	Workers produce 0.01% more for each Worker
	Each year, your Military are promoted, granting 1 more Might
		Militia - 1 Might
		Soldier - 2 Might
		Veteran - 3 Might
		Elite - 4 Might
	Lower position Military are preferred for exchanging
